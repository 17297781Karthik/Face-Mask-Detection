# Face Mask Detection System## OverviewThis project implements a real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not, based on input images or video streams.## Table of Contents- [Overview](#overview)- [Features](#features)- [Dataset](#dataset)- [Installation](#installation)- [Usage](#usage)- [Algorithm](#algorithm)- [Real-time Detection](#real-time-detection)- [Results](#results)- [Limitations and Future Work](#limitations-and-future-work)## Features- Real-time face mask detection using OpenCV.- Deep learning-based CNN model for high accuracy.- Detection of multiple faces with and without masks in real-time.## DatasetThe model is trained on a dataset containing images of people with and without face masks. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to improve model accuracy and generalization.## Installation1.
